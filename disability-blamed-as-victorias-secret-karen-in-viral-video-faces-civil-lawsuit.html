Discover the full story behind this sensational viral video that has taken the internet by storm.</p><strong>Maybe you are interested:</strong><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Background_story_behind_the_viral_video_of_%E2%80%9CVictorias_Secret_Karen%E2%80%9D></span>Background story behind the viral video of “Victoria’s Secret Karen”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The background story behind the viral video of “Victoria’s Secret Karen” centers around an incident that occurred in July 2021 at a Victoria’s Secret store in New Jersey. Ijeoma Ukenta, a black woman, was attempting to redeem a coupon for free panties when she encountered Abigail Elphick, who would later become known as “Karen” in the video. The situation escalated quickly, with Elphick allegedly attacking Ukenta and having a meltdown, which was captured on video by Ukenta.</p><p>In the video, Elphick can be seen screaming and rolling on the floor before slapping Ukenta. She then throws a shirt onto the counter and buries her face into her hands, claiming she does not want to be recorded. The incident caused a stir online as the video went viral, leading to widespread discussion and outrage.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>The incident took place at a Victoria’s Secret store in New Jersey.</li><li>Ijeoma Ukenta was attempting to redeem a coupon for free panties when she encountered Abigail Elphick.</li><li>Elphick had a meltdown, attacked Ukenta, and engaged in disruptive behavior.</li><li>The entire incident was captured on video by Ukenta and shared online.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_led_to_Abigail_Elphicks_meltdown_in_the_Victorias_Secret_store></span>What led to Abigail Elphick’s meltdown in the Victoria’s Secret store?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The exact events that led to Abigail Elphick’s meltdown in the Victoria’s Secret store are not entirely clear. However, according to court filings in Ijeoma Ukenta’s civil lawsuit against Elphick, Victoria’s Secret, the mall, and its security company for negligence, it is stated that Ukenta asked Elphick to give her some space in accordance with COVID-19 restrictions at the time.</p><p>This seemingly innocuous request quickly escalated into a physical altercation, with Elphick allegedly slapping Ukenta. The specific triggers for Elphick’s meltdown and aggressive behavior are not explicitly mentioned in the court filings or available public information. However, Elphick’s defense claims that her actions were a result of her disability and the fear that being filmed would lead to consequences such as losing her job and apartment.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-2></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Ijeoma Ukenta requested Abigail Elphick to give her some space in adherence to COVID-19 restrictions.</li><li>The specific triggers for Elphick’s meltdown are not explicitly mentioned in available information.</li><li>Elphick’s defense attributes her actions to her disability and fear of repercussions.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Civil_lawsuit_filed_by_Ijeoma_Ukenta_against_Abigail_Elphick_and_others_involved></span>Civil lawsuit filed by Ijeoma Ukenta against Abigail Elphick and others involved<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Civil lawsuit filed by Ijeoma Ukenta against Abigail Elphick and others involved" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disability_blamed_as_victoria_s_secret_karen_in_viral_video_faces_civil_lawsuit.jpeg title="Civil lawsuit filed by Ijeoma Ukenta against Abigail Elphick and others involved" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In July, almost two years after the original incident took place, Ijeoma Ukenta filed a civil suit against Abigail Elphick, Victoria’s Secret, the mall where the store was located, and its security company for negligence. The lawsuit alleges that Victoria’s Secret ignored the assault on Ukenta, failed to intervene or provide assistance or protection when security finally arrived, and further humiliated Ukenta by asking her to leave the mall.</p><p>The civil lawsuit seeks compensation for damages incurred by Ukenta due to the assault and negligence of Victoria’s Secret, Abigail Elphick, and other entities involved. It also aims to hold them accountable for their actions during the incident.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-3></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Ijeoma Ukenta filed a civil lawsuit against Abigail Elphick, Victoria’s Secret, the mall, and its security company.</li><li>The lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of Victoria’s Secret and failure to protect Ukenta during the incident.</li><li>Ukenta seeks compensation for damages incurred and accountability for those involved.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Abigail_Elphicks_defense_explains_her_actions_and_behavior_in_the_video></span>Abigail Elphick’s defense explains her actions and behavior in the video<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async actions alt="Abigail Elphick" and behavior defense explains her in s src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disability_blamed_as_victoria_s_secret_karen_in_viral_video_faces_civil_lawsuit-1.jpeg the title="Abigail Elphick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In response to the civil lawsuit filed by Ijeoma Ukenta, Abigail Elphick’s defense offered an explanation for her actions and behavior in the viral video. According to her defense, Elphick is disabled and has a long history of medical and psychological conditions. They argued that her mental illness triggered the breakdown, particularly due to her fear that being filmed would result in losing her job and housing.</p><p>This defense attempts to provide context for Elphick’s aggressive behavior during the incident at Victoria’s Secret. It suggests that there may be underlying factors contributing to her actions beyond what is seen in the viral video. However, it remains up to legal proceedings to determine how these factors will be considered in relation to the civil lawsuit.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-4></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Abigail Elphick’s defense claims she is disabled with a long history of medical and psychological conditions.</li><li>Mental illness is cited as a trigger for her breakdown during the incident.</li><li>The fear of losing her job and housing due to being filmed is highlighted as a contributing factor.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Response_of_Victorias_Secret_and_mall_security_to_the_incident_according_to_Ukentas_lawsuit></span>Response of Victoria’s Secret and mall security to the incident according to Ukenta’s lawsuit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ijeoma Ukenta’s civil lawsuit against Victoria’s Secret alleges negligence on their part in responding to the incident. According to the lawsuit, while the assault was taking place, Victoria’s Secret employees ignored what was happening. When mall security finally arrived, Ukenta claims they were dismissive and indifferent to her concerns for safety. The lawsuit further alleges that security failed to remove Abigail Elphick or offer any assistance or protection to Ukenta.</p><p>These allegations suggest that both Victoria’s Secret and the mall security company did not adequately respond to the situation and failed in their duty of care towards Ukenta. The lawsuit seeks accountability for their actions or lack thereof during the incident.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-5></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Ijeoma Ukenta’s civil lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of Victoria’s Secret and mall security.</li><li>Victoria’s Secret employees ignored the assault and did not intervene.</li><li>Mall security was dismissive towards Ukenta and failed to offer assistance or protection.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reactions_and_consequences_faced_by_Ukenta_and_Elphick_after_the_video_went_viral></span>Reactions and consequences faced by Ukenta and Elphick after the video went viral<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The viral video of the incident between Ijeoma Ukenta and Abigail Elphick garnered significant attention online and attracted various reactions from viewers. Many expressed outrage over Elphick’s behavior and supported Ukenta as a victim of racial discrimination. The video fueled discussions about racial inequality, public meltdowns, and customer service standards.</p><p>Following the incident, both Ukenta and Elphick faced consequences in different ways. For Ukenta, she continued to advocate for herself by filing a civil lawsuit against those involved in the incident. Additionally, she received support from individuals online who rallied behind her cause. However, it is important to note that she also faced backlash, trolling, death threats, and harassment as a result of going public with her experiences.</p><p>In contrast, Abigail Elphick faced public scrutiny and backlash for her actions in the video. She was widely criticized and became known as “Victoria’s Secret Karen.” The consequences of her behavior extended to her personal life, with allegations of harassment and threats against her and her family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-6></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>The viral video attracted significant attention online and sparked discussions about racial discrimination and customer service.</li><li>Ijeoma Ukenta faced both support and backlash, including trolling, death threats, and harassment.</li><li>Abigail Elphick faced public scrutiny, criticism, harassment, and allegations of threats against her and her family.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Financial_support_received_by_Ukenta_through_crowdfunding_platforms_and_discussion_on_motivations_for_seeking_donations></span>Financial support received by Ukenta through crowdfunding platforms and discussion on motivations for seeking donations<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the incident and the viral video gaining widespread attention, Ijeoma Ukenta received financial support through crowdfunding platforms. According to reports, she has received approximately $104,465 from roughly 5,000 individuals on GoFundMe. These donations were made by people who sympathized with Ukenta’s experience and wanted to support her legal battle against those involved in the incident.</p><p>The motivations behind seeking donations can vary from individual to individual.

Additionally, crowdfunding can also serve as a way for people to show solidarity with victims of racial discrimination or seek justice in cases where they feel systemic barriers are present.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Key_Points-7></span>Key Points:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Ijeoma Ukenta received financial support through crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe.</li><li>The donations are intended to help cover legal fees associated with pursuing a civil lawsuit.</li><li>Crowdfunding can serve as a way for people to show solidarity and seek justice in cases of racial discrimination.</li><p>In conclusion, the viral video of Abigail Elphick’s encounter with a Victoria’s Secret employee dubbed as “Karen” has sparked widespread attention and raised important discussions about customer service and racial profiling.
