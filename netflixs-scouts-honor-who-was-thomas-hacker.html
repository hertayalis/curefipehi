It features first-person accounts of abuse that children faced at the hands of scoutmasters, but even in that evil diorama there’s one name that stands out: <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Hacker</a></strong>. So who was he?</p><h2 id=h-who-was-thomas-hacker-from-scout-s-honor data-injectable=false>Who was Thomas Hacker from ‘Scout’s Honor’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Thomas Hacker was a Church leader, a teacher, a scoutmaster and an admitted serial pedophile. Per the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Tribune</a>, Hacker molested hundreds of children during his tenure in the Boy Scouts for two decades until he left the organization in the 1980s.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>His upbringing is just as tragic as his crimes. His father was an alcoholic who would beat his mother, and he was reportedly molested by his grandmother throughout his whole life, up until he reached his teens.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>When he was 13, he “turned outside the family for care and love and, obviously, didn’t do a very good job of that,” and began his crusade of sex crimes toward young boys. He was also intelligent enough to earn a Master’s in Guidance and Psychology, and hid his condition enough to marry and become the father of three children.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Hacker had a nice career in the public sector, and worked as the Chairman of the Indianapolis Mayor’s Task Force to integrate public schools in the 1960s. He was formerly charged with assault and battery of a minor for contact with a 14-year-old boy.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>He was sentenced to probation and psych evals, and later authorities would identify at least 51 more victims. Despite his arrest, he moved to Chicago and gained employment as a teacher while hiding his conviction.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>After that, he was arrested again in 1973 for illegal contact with a child and moved to another school. He didn’t slow down, either. He became a Church leader in Burbank, California, and started volunteering with the Boy Scouts of America.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>He was constantly surrounded by minors, and he sexually abused hundreds up until the 1980s. He was also arrested in 1976 for throwing a kid on the floor and pulling off his pants, but he also only got probation for that. It wasn’t until February of 1988 that he was finally arrested for good.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>He was sentenced to 100 years for the abuse of an 11-year-old, and when asked to provide a number for the amount of victims over the years, Hacker said he “wouldn’t be able to give you a number. I mean it’s horrible to say, but there’s so many out there. In scouting alone, there were more than hundreds. Gosh, there were probably a hundred in three or four years… I was really involved with Scouts, and I had an outlet for my deviancy.”</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>As to how he knew he could continue to get away with his crimes despite being added as an “ineligible volunteer” in the early ’70s, he said “I knew it would be [easy to get back into scouting every time I was removed owing to a lack of background checks]. I was positive. I never even gave it a second thought.”</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=false>Hacker died in prison at 81 in 2018 after his heart failed at Big Muddy River Correctional Center in Ina, Illinois.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZqedpJu5qsTSZqqcp6WpwG60zqemq2Wnnbxuw8CsZK2gn6KutHnHmpqknaJk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnetflixs-scouts-honor-who-was-thomas-hacker.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rittz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rittz.html>Rittz</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kody-brown.html>Kody Brown - Age, Bio, Birthday, Family, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kody-brown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
