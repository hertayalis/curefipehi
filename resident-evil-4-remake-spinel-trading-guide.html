<time>24 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=131 data-injectable=true data-video=true>The reviews — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including our own</a> — are conclusive, and agree that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a></strong> is one of the best games of 2023.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The spectacular remake levels up everything that made the original great, and injects new elements, enemies, and challenges to keep even veteran players guessing. It ramps up the horror, evens out the writing, and maintains an overarching “fun” factor that’s been stealing sleep from gamers for nearly a week now.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>A wave of fresh Resident Evil fans join the fold every month, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re discovering all the minor changes</a> and significant tweaks made to the original. Thankfully, the Merchant is still a staple of Leon’s journey through rural Spain, but the way he does business is slightly altered. Don’t worry, he’ll still buy your items at a high price, but a fresh option to trade is stumping some gamers. It might not seem overly worthwhile — as you snatch up pesetas to spend on upgrades and fresh items — but clever planning could see the Merchant’s Spinel trading section save your skin in more than one way.</p><h2 id=h-can-you-trade-with-spinels-in-resident-evil-4-remake data-injectable=false>Can you trade with spinels in Resident Evil 4 Remake?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>The concept behind the Merchant’s new trading option is perfectly straightforward. Leon’s cloaked, mysterious tagalong now offers up a fresh section, merely titled “Trade,” which provides a range of items available for trade. Rather than sell those shiny Spinels, you collect them — largely as payment for completed tasks — and then offload them in trade for something much more valuable.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>On my first playthrough, I chose to save up my first few rounds of Spinels as a way to obtain the Punisher early on. From time to time, I shaved away at my backlog to buy up a yellow herb or some extra gunpowder for crafting, but my toxic gamer tendencies largely saw me hanging onto each new batch of Spinels just in case something better came along.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>And, while a few shiny, pricey new options did crop up as I worked my way through the game, very few were worth my hoarding. Instead, I consistently kneecapped myself by avoiding those yellow herb purchases — which could have seen me headed into early fights with far more health to lose — and saving up Spinels for a future that would never come.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Don’t be me, folks. Spend your Spinels as you work your way through the game, and use them as a way to keep yourself afloat in areas with lower payoff, or more expensive upgrades. There are a few additions to the list that are worth an immediate trade — those treasure maps will pay off, I promise — and a few that are worth saving for, and we’re here to help you decide which ones are the right fit for your play style.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Resident_Evil_4_trade.jpg><p data-characters=692 data-current-count=992 data-injectable=true>A treasure map for the village will only run you a single Spinel, so snatch that one up as early as possible. It will aid you in collecting all of the various treasures scattered across the village, and additionally points out where items like blue medallions are located. Considering how well some of them are hidden, you’ll lean on that map plenty, making it well worth the low trading cost. The next two maps — one for the castle, and one for the island — are a touch more expensive, at five Spinels a pop, but both are similarly helpful in gathering up all the goodies each stage has to offer. They’ll come available in the Merchant’s inventory as each new area is unlocked.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Several excellent weapons, and weapon attachments, are additionally available for trade. Why spend thousands of pesetas on the Matilda or a high-powered scope when they’re available for just a few Spinels? It’s worth checking the trade section each time you chat up the Merchant, just to peruse how the items have changed, and rearrange your priorities for the next chapter.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Weapons and attachments for trade</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Punisher_RE4_Remake.jpg><ul data-current-count=265.5 data-injectable=false><li>Punisher — 5 Spinel</li><li>Matilda — 10 Spinel&nbsp;</li><li>Matilda Stock – 12 Spinel</li><li>Red 9 Stock – 9 Spinel</li><li>TMP Stock – 8 Spinel</li><li>Laser Sight – 10 Spinel</li><li>High-powered Scope – 7 Spinel</li></ul><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=696.5 data-injectable=true>Several of these are absolutely vital trades, as they will make you far more efficient in a fight. The Punisher should be an early priority, since it runs so cheap and has the added benefit of being one of the game’s best handguns, and the laser sight will only make it more effective. You’ll also use far less health with that high-powered scope attached, which will allow you to pick off enemies from a hearty distance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>There are also two variations of the attaché case available for trade. Basic upgrades to the case itself, which allow more space for you to fill up with weapons, ammo, and materials, are purchasable from the Merchant himself, but you can trade to get the Black or Red attaché customizations. It’s worth noting that upgrading to the Red option will increase the frequency with which red herbs are dropped, and going for Black will increase drops of large resources, used for ammo crafting.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Attaché case upgrades</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Resident_Evil_4_remake_trade.jpg><ul data-current-count=502.5 data-injectable=true><li>Black — 8 Spinel</li><li>Red — 12 Spinel</li></ul><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>A range of smaller, but more plentiful, items are also offered up in the trade menu. These will largely be available for trade more than once, but they’re not entirely unlimited. They are also relatively frequent among enemy drops and crates, but they’ll come in handy in a pinch.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Health and crafting trade options</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Yellow_Herb_RE4_Remake.jpg><ul data-current-count=76.5 data-injectable=false><li>Yellow herb — 3 Spinel</li><li>Gunpowder — 2 to 3 Spinel</li></ul><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=433.5 data-injectable=true>There are also a few tradeable items that are purely used to line your wallet. You can trade for things like yellow diamonds to add to other treasures, or to sell back to the Merchant for pesetas. I would recommend against trading for these during your first play through, as they’re not nearly so useful as the other items, and Spinels are limited.&nbsp;</p><ul data-current-count=160.5 data-injectable=false><li>Yellow diamond – 3 Spinel</li><li>Red Beryl – 4 Spinel</li><li>Elegant mask – 2 Spinel</li><li>Chalice of Atonement – 3 Spinel</li></ul><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=647.5 data-injectable=true>The trade section also offers up two exclusive upgrade tickets, which can be used to unlock the ultimate upgrade for any weapon, regardless of how many upgrades you’ve purchased. Without the tickets, the exclusive upgrade is only available to purchase — for a pretty penny — after every other upgrade is in place. They’re pretty pricey themselves — running at 30 Spinel for the first and 40 Spinel for the second — but they’ll save you heaps of money when used right.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RE4_trading.jpg><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>The final two items available for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trade through the Merchant</a> are more plentiful, and can provide a steady stream of revenue and perks throughout the game. While a Velvet Blue trade won’t get you more than a boost in pesetas, buying up a gold token or two could serve you well. These combine with other tokens, earned through the Merchant’s firing ranges, to win prizes. The charms you get for these tokens vary in usefulness, but some of them will give you a major boost as you take on the game’s various challenges.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Unlimited trade items</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Velvet_blue_RE4_Remake.jpg><ul data-current-count=520.5 data-injectable=true><li>Velvet Blue — 3 Spinel</li><li>Gold Token – 3 Spinel</li></ul><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=false>The inclusion of a trade option adds a delightful element to filling out your inventory in Resident Evil 4 Remake, and one that’ll save you loads of money if you use it right. Leaning on some of those early inclusions, like the Punisher and treasure maps, will easily pay for themselves in just a few rounds and allow you to save your cash for much more necessary purchases. Just make sure not to blow all your Spinels on yellow diamonds and tokens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoqZ6rmZmyr8CMnq2ipF1perOxzJqinmWjpbavsctmq6uZlJ67qHnGrqCdnV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fresident-evil-4-remake-spinel-trading-guide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-farrah-fawcetts-son-redmond-oneal-go-to-jail-and-where-is-he-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-farrah-fawcetts-son-redmond-oneal-go-to-jail-and-where-is-he-now.html>Why did Farrah Fawcetts son Redmond ONeal go to jail and where is he now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./john-ducey-net-worth.html>John Ducey Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./john-ducey-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
