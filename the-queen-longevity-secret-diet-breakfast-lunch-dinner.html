It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once."</p><p id=etGokd9Kpcp-H data-wc=54>As for an alcoholic tipple, Her Majesty was&nbsp;partial to the odd gin. In 2017, Darren McGrady spoke out on reports that the Queen drank four cocktails a day. He told : <strong>"She'd be pickled if she drank that much. All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favourite drink."</strong></p><p id=eFqqQn47iMoKu data-wc=35>Darren added that when the Queen did&nbsp;have a drink with dinner, it was&nbsp;typically a glass of her favourite German sweet wine.
