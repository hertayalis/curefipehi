<time>18 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Jimin, one of BTS’s finest, is a singer and dancer who, alongside other talented artists, works tirelessly to keep South Korea on the entertainment map.&nbsp;Also a songwriter, Jimin joined the boy band in 2013 and continued to prove his importance to the band and to the industry.&nbsp;We bet you are eager to know what his role with the band has been, along with other interesting facts.&nbsp;Here’s everything you need to know about the Korean artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Age – Who is Jimin from BTS?</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born Park Ji-min on October 13, 1995, to his parents in Geumjeong District, Busan, South Korea.&nbsp;Growing up in Busan, he attended Hodong Elementary School as well as Yonsan Middle School.&nbsp;The talented artist admits to having been greatly inspired by the South Korean singer Rain.&nbsp;Before school, Jimin was already very interested in music and was very inclined to follow his passion.&nbsp;It was this burning desire that prompted her to take dance lessons at the Busan High School of Arts.&nbsp;He also learned jump and lock dance at Just Dance Academy.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, Jimin participated in a dance audition which landed him a spot at Big Hit Entertainment, before moving on to Korean Arts High School.&nbsp;The following year, he joined the K-pop group BTS as a dancer and singer.&nbsp;With the release of the band’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Plus de rêve</span><span>&nbsp;that year, it debuted and was quite exceptional.&nbsp;Jimin wasn’t shy about trying different things while still being a member of the group.&nbsp;For him, it was more about passion than income.</span></p><p><span>He released a solo single,&nbsp;</span><span>Lie</span><span>&nbsp;which was included in BTS’s second studio album,&nbsp;</span><span>Wings</span><span>&nbsp;in 2016. He also released another track&nbsp;</span><span>Serendipity</span><span>&nbsp;which was included in the album,&nbsp;</span><span>Love Yourself</span><span>.&nbsp;Jimin reportedly broke boundaries with his two solo tracks making waves on the Billboard Korea charts.</span></p><p><span>He did not stop there, the singer also collaborated a lot with the group.&nbsp;Together with one of BTS member Jungkook, he made&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas Day,</span><span>&nbsp;tagged the Korean version of the song&nbsp;</span><span>Mistletoe</span><span>&nbsp;by Justin Bieber.&nbsp;A few other collaborations followed before Jimin appeared in the series&nbsp;</span><span>Hello Counselor, Please Take Care of My Fridge</span><span>&nbsp;and a few other shows.</span></p><p><span>In December 2018, Jimin released his first solo work without BTS Crew titled&nbsp;</span><span>Promise</span><span>.&nbsp;Besides, the South Korean music star is also known for his unique dance moves which sets him apart from the rest of the K-Pop group.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His brother and his family</span></strong></h2><p><span>The names of Jimin’s parents are not known.&nbsp;However, it is known that the talented artist is the eldest of his parents and grew up with his father and mother.&nbsp;Jimin’s father owns a cafe called Alice’s Table in Busan.&nbsp;Jimin is not the only child of his parents, he has a younger brother, a brother named Park Jihyun.&nbsp;There is not much information regarding his brother;&nbsp;However, we already know that they grew up together.</span></p><p><span>The singer’s love for his family is seen in the film as he gushes over them on social media.&nbsp;He often posts videos and photos of precious moments shared with his family, leaving his followers in awe of his wonderful loved ones.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Does he have a girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jimin always leaves his fans and the general public curious about vague reports about his personal life.&nbsp;What’s even more disturbing is that it’s almost the same with all members of the K-pop group, BTS.&nbsp;Jimin’s discretion about his love life as well as that of the other members now leaves his fans endlessly guessing who might be the one who might be the first.</span></p><p><span>Although many names have come up, the singer is believed to be single at the moment.&nbsp;He was once rumored to have a relationship with Han Seung-Yeon from KARA.&nbsp;However, he never responded to the rumors regarding his love life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements: height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>BTS’s Jimin would hardly go unnoticed with his outstanding handsome looks.&nbsp;Who wouldn’t give her dazzling eyes and glowing face a second look?&nbsp;Its average height is 1.75 m and its proportional weight is 61 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid
