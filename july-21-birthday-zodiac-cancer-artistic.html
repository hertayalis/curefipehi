That‘s a lot of goodness rolled into one person. It doesn’t stop there. You are bestowed with intuitive and artistic qualities that can provide a particular movement within you. Different forms of art have different effects on your day-to-day life.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><br><p>As the <strong>zodiac sign for July 21st is the cusp of Cancer and Leo</strong>, you can be irritable when motionless. Those born on this day can be very outgoing and sociable individuals. Naturally, you are protective and have a deep concern for your loved ones.</p><p>The July 21st birthday personality characteristics predict that you <a href=#>love your family</a> and your home. It is quite charming as are you, Cancer. On the other hand, you have a few weaknesses.<a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/21-july-birthday-cancer.jpg alt="IF YOUR BIRTHDAY IS JULY 21, then you are hypersensitive, observant and expressive." width=350 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> Those of you born under this zodiac sign can be <a href=#>moody, grumpy, or unstable</a>. You stand your ground, however, when it comes to your individuality and your space. Cancer, according to the <strong>July 21st birthday</strong>, are personalities who are very inventive or creative. You have a spectacular imagination. People love you, as you are a wonderful person who is always helpful and nice.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>Can we talk about your love life? The July 21 birthday love compatibility analysis says that you can be unrealistic and naive when it comes to issues of the heart. You can be overly sensitive and disappointed as you tend to expect too much.</p><p>If today July 21 is your birthday, you can do many things as an artist, but you cannot make someone love you or act the way you want them to. Despite your best efforts, you should redesign your approach to <a href=#>love and commitment</a>.</p><h2><span>Personality</span></h2><p>As the <strong>July 21 horoscope </strong>rightly says, you are incredible, and someone would be happy to share your <a href=#>goals and dreams</a> with you. Because the person born on this day has suffered disappointments before, you are likely a Crab that has trust issues.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>A person desiring to make you their “Boo” should be funny, emotionally secure, and have the same values. This <a href=#>Cancer birthday</a> personality is compassionate and easy to talk to. You will likely want to talk about your fantasies. You love a rainy night.</p><p>A job has never been hard for the July 21 zodiac person to find. You are <a href=#>well-groomed, talented, and skilled</a>. What more could a sensible employer want than someone like you? Sometimes, you are hired based on your capabilities rather than your experience. You are innovative, and that is what most employers are looking for&nbsp;bright and energetic personnel.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>You have discipline too except for when it comes to shopping. Those born on this birthday July 21st can shop until you drop. Mainly though, you save and prepare for the future so, this typically will not bind you if done in moderation. Sunsigns.org has information on everything under the sun including tips on how to <a title="10 Tips To Budget & Save Money" href=#>budget and save money</a>.</p><h2><span>Horoscope</span></h2><p>The <strong>July 21 birthday</strong> personalities typically are easy to be influenced, believe it or not. When it comes to picking up bad habits, you will! Contrary to the Crab’s nature, there are times when you do not take care of personal hygiene; basic grooming efforts go lacking, and more so, your <a href=#>attitude toward health</a>.</p><p>Habits likely to draw Cancer’s attention are smoking and drinking. The two go hand in hand. I am sorry Cancer, but both of those habits stink in more ways than one. It is suggested that you should use these vices in moderation. Try doing something productive and positive such as exercising. The next time you splurge, treat yourself to a spa day. This could be very relaxing and enjoyable.</p><p>The <strong>July 21 zodiac personality</strong> shows you can have negative traits such as being <a href=#>irritable, grumpy, and obsessive</a>. If you behave this way, you will be left all alone in this world. Otherwise, you are active at home and on the job. You desire someone to share it with someone sensitive to your dreams.</p><p>Occasionally, you wind up being disappointed because of your <a href=#>unrealistic expectations</a>. Then you likely will go out and have a few drinks to avoid depression or stress and could form an addiction. Stick to more solutions that are positive so we can talk about everything under the sun long into retirement years. Take care of yourself&nbsp;you are most important.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/july21cancerbirthdaycalendar.jpg alt="july 21 cancer birthday calendar" width=400 height=250 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span><strong>Famous People And Celebrities Born On&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>July 21</span></strong></h3><p>Korey Cooper, <a href=#>Ernest Hemingway</a>, Don Knotts, <a href=#>Damian Marley</a>, Anthony Santos, Romeo Santos, Isaac Stern</p><p>See: <a href=#><strong>Famous Celebrities Born On July 21</strong></a></p><h3><span><strong>This Day That Year – July 21 In History</strong></span></h3><p><strong>1730</strong> – Holland imposes the death penalty on charges relating to sodomy.<br><strong>1836</strong> – Laprairie and St John, Quebec open the first Canadian railroad<br><strong>1904</strong> – The Trans-Siberian railroad (4,607 miles long) is completed after 13 years.<br><strong>1952</strong> – Kern County California’s 7.8 earthquake kills 14 people</p><p><span>July 21</span>&nbsp;<a href=#>Karka Rashi</a>&nbsp;<span>(Vedic Moon Sign)<br></span><span>July 21</span> <a href=#>Chinese Zodiac SHEEP</a><b></b></p><h3><strong><span>Birthday Planet</span></strong></h3><p>Your ruling planets are the <strong><a href=#>Moon</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;& <a href=#>Sun</a></strong></p><p><strong>Moon</strong> symbolizes your emotional temperament, intuitions, and empathetic feelings.<br><strong>Sun</strong> symbolizes your spirit, creativity, energy, <a href=#>courage, and determination</a>.</p><h3><span><b>Birthday Symbols</b></span></h3><p><a href=#><strong>The Crab</strong></a> Is The Symbol For The Cancer Sun Sign<br><a href=#><strong>The Lion</strong></a> Is The Symbol For The Leo Sun Sign</p><h3><span><b>Birthday Tarot Card</b></span></h3><p>Your Birthday Tarot Card is <a href=#><strong>The World</strong></a>.
