DeWitt Taylor High School in Pierson, the same school Jones attended and played baseball.</span></p><p><span>The name “Chipper” was a nickname he acquired from his father and family members who saw him as a chip off the old block.&nbsp;As a child, Jones’ love of baseball was largely influenced by his father’s position as a coach.&nbsp;So it’s no surprise that he started playing when he was 7 years old.</span></p><p><span>A freshman at Taylor High School, he was a starting pitcher and short-stop and played right field with a local American Legion baseball team.</span></p><p><span>Jones completed his education at Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, where he played for three seasons, leading his team to a Double-A title.</span></p><p><span>Chipper Jones graduated from college with a 7-3 record, walked just 25, batted .483 and hit 100 batters.&nbsp;Although selected by the Atlanta Braves as the first overall pick in the 1990 Major League Baseball draft, Jones played in the minor leagues until making his debut on the 11th September 1993 as the youngest major league player.</span></p><p><span>For 19 seasons in his MLB career, he played for the Atlanta Braves only missed one season (1994) due to a torn ACL in his left knee which left him on the roster disabled for the entire abbreviated season.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he returned in 1995 to actively participate in 140 games and achieved a high level of success by placing second in baseball’s Rookie of the Year voting.</span></p><p><span>He appeared in the 1995 World Series in which the Braves won six games against the Cleveland Indians, as well as the 1996 World Series.</span></p><p><span>A few years later (1995-1999) Chipper Jones won the National League MVP award after becoming the first player to hit over .300 (.319).&nbsp;In 1995, he won Player’s Choice Best Player and Sporting News Player of the Year.&nbsp;In 1999, he won three awards, including the Most Valuable Player award;&nbsp;Player’s Choice Outstanding Player of the Year;&nbsp;and the National League Silver Slugger Award.</span></p><p><span>After his first contract with the team ran out, he signed a six-year contract worth $90 million in 2000, which saw him play his best games with the Braves.&nbsp;That year, he won his second National League Silver Slugger award.</span></p><p><span>Jones reached another milestone in his careerIn 2006, he became the absolute RBI leader for the Braves with his 1,144th career hit on June 10, 2006. In 2009, he ranked 10th on the Top 50 list baseball players.&nbsp;He was 36 when he won his first batting title, becoming the oldest switch hitter to win the title in 2008.</span></p><p><span>Despite a retirement discussion with Atlanta Braves management in June 2010, after tearing his left knee on August 10, Jones had told a press conference that he would not retire because he did not want to not present the final image of an injured retiree to fans..</span></p><p><span>The chipper returned in 2011 after his full recovery from injury to record his 1,500th point against the Florida Marlins on April 13.&nbsp;He played 126 games.&nbsp;Despite speculation that he would retire that year, he announced he would play in 2012, the final year of his contract.&nbsp;with the Atlanta Braves.</span></p><p><span>Jone played his final game in the 2012 Wild Card League playoffs, in which the Braves lost 6–3. He won the Marvin Miller Man of the Year award that year and played in 112 games.</span></p><p><span>During his 19-year career, Chipper Jones recorded a .303 total batting average, .401 OBP, .529 SLG, and 2,726 hits in 2,499 games played.&nbsp;He was honored with a fan tribute song titled ‘The Chipper Jones Song’ and was featured in a number of sports blogs following his retirement announcement.</span></p><p><strong><br><span>Family, wife, children and business</span></strong></p><p><span>Chipper Jones is a family man with five children: Matthew Jones, Shea Jones, Larry Wayne Jones III and Tristen Jones.&nbsp;His youngest son was born to him from his current wife.</span></p><p><span>He was married three times to three different women: first with&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Karin Fulford (1992-1999) and Sharon Logonov (2000-2012) and his current wife.</span></span></p><p><span>Jones’ first marriage broke up after it was revealed that he not only had an extramarital affair with a waitress, but that relationship also produced a son.&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>His current wife is Taylor Higgins, a former Playboy model whom he married in 2015 and the two welcomed their son, Cutler Ridge Jones, on January 11, 2017 in Atlanta.</span></span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>He has an athletic height as tall as 6 feet 3 inches or 1.91 meters which served him well in the game.&nbsp;Without a doubt, like all athletes, Chipper still works out regularly to stay in shape.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibmJ69sbHRZqGoppWoeri1xZ5knKCZobGzsc1mnZqlmaHGbq3Fn5iiqqNirqixjKGcop%2BYqXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchipper-jones-wife-children-family-affairs-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./midnight-sun-could-new-book-from-stephenie-meyer-mean-were-getting-a-twilight-6-movie-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./midnight-sun-could-new-book-from-stephenie-meyer-mean-were-getting-a-twilight-6-movie-html.html>Could New Book From Stephenie Meyer Mean We're Getting a 'Twilight 6' Movie?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bruce-willis-cozies-up-wife-emma-heming-private-celebration-daughters-mabel-evelyn.html>Bruce Willis cozies up to wife Emma Heming amid health battle in rare peek inside their private cele</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bruce-willis-cozies-up-wife-emma-heming-private-celebration-daughters-mabel-evelyn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
